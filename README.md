This is the first website I had to make during my T Level Digital course. It is for this reason it is sub par at best. This is the scenario I was given for the website:





You work for Mantis Solutions, a software
company based in the North of England.
They have secured a contract for developing
a digital solution for a new client,
Bean and Brew.
Bean and Brew is a small local chain of cafes
and coffee shops based around Harrogate
and Leeds. They currently have the following
venues and services:
1. Coffee shops
2. Small local cuisine restaurants
3. Baking lessons
4. Bakery takeaway

Bean and Brew were one of the first
companies in the UK to use fair-trade coffee
and all organic milk for their products. Each
drink is made exactly to your specifications,
for a personal service. They also offer their
trademarked flavoured coffees, breakfast
items such as porridge, small sweet treats,
and pressed sandwiches. Recently they’ve also
added frappes and fruit smoothies in addition
to seasonal treats such as the pumpkin spiced
latte (for Halloween) and various assorted
baked goods.




THE BUSINESS NEED
The owner of Bean and Brew wants a digital
solution developed to:
5. Book a space at one of the 3 local
restaurants (Harrogate, Leeds,
Knaresborough Castle)
6. Be able to pre-order a coffee for collection
7. Allow customers to pre-book (online)
baking lessons


The client has carried out some market
research to identify potential features that
their existing customers suggested, these
could be included in the final digital solution.
The research identified the following:

8. Pre-order baked goods for collection
9. Customisable baked goods hampers
10. Creating customer accounts to speed up
re-ordering
11. Social media posting/sharing features
(‘Rate my cake’)
